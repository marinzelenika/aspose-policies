We at Aspose strive to bring you of the best and most useful APIs for developing solutions efficiently. To this end we have introduced many APIs to suit your needs. Sometimes a feature set is so popular it warrants moving it into a standalone product. On the other hand, some features may not have been commercially viable as a standalone product and as a result, we may decide to merge an existing product into an existing product. In either case we offer a [clear upgrade path](/policies/product-migration/) from the original to the destination product.

This page lists all those products which have been migrated (merged or split). Note that for a product that's merged, the original is no longer sold and are not included in Aspose.Total as a standalone product.

For more information, please [contact the sales team](https://about.aspose.com/contact/).
