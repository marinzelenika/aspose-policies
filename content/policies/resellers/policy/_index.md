##### **Aspose Reseller Policy**

###### **Discount**

Aspose grants approved resellers a 10% discount on sales of select products. Aspose will not approve a higher discount for any reseller for any reason.

###### **Price Changes**

Prices are subject to change upon notice by Aspose to Resellers. Aspose will announce price changes before they are made through the Reseller Newsletter. Resellers are obligated to ensure they can receive email communications from Aspose.

###### **Customer Autonomy**

Resellers agree that customers are free to choose between purchasing from a reseller or directly from Aspose for new orders or renewals of existing orders. If a reseller opts to no longer offer Aspose's products, for any reason, they must refer customers to Aspose and fully cooperate with Aspose in connection therewith.

###### **No Redistribution**

Resellers may not act as a distributor. Resellers may not resell Aspose's products to other resellers for further resale or redistribution.
